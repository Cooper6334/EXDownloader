# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a basic Chrome Extension project called "Hello Extensions" that demonstrates the fundamentals of Chrome extension development. The project follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format and serves as a simple "Hello World" example for learning extension development.

## Project Structure

- `manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest file defining extension metadata and permissions
- `hello.html` - Popup HTML file that displays when the extension icon is clicked
- `popup.js` - JavaScript file that runs when the popup is opened
- `hello_extensions.png` - Extension icon file
- `README.md` - Project documentation with setup instructions

## Development Commands

This project doesn't require a build system or package manager. Development is done directly with the source files:

1. **Load Extension for Development**: Load the entire project directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select this directory

2. **Testing**: Test the extension by clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar

3. **Debugging**: Use Chrome Developer Tools to debug the popup and extension code

## Architecture Notes

- **Manifest V3**: Uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format
- **Popup-based Extension**: Simple popup extension that displays HTML content when clicked
- **No Background Scripts**: This basic extension doesn't use background scripts or content scripts
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no build process or external libraries

## Extension Development Workflow

1. Make changes to HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. Reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` â†’ click reload button)
3. Test functionality by clicking the extension icon
4. Debug using Chrome Developer Tools if needed

## Key Files to Modify

- `manifest.json` - Add permissions, change extension metadata, or add new script files
- `hello.html` - Modify popup UI and structure
- `popup.js` - Add popup functionality and logic
